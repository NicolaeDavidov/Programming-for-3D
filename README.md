# Programming-for-3D

This module advanced my knowledge by using tools that add specific technical understanding of visualisation and interaction in 3D environments.

What I have achieved by doing this module:
1. Knowledge of vector graphics as applied to geometrical problems in 3D and be able to analyse and review requirements for visualisation tasks
2. Extend and apply knowledge related to the physics of light and colour perception, and use simplified models to mimic those physics
3. Apply the methods and techniques learnt during this module to implement critical aspects of an interactive 3D application 


## Module Assignment:

Create a two-story building that includes a front door that a first-person controller opens and closes. You should place within the scene some variations of the objects modelled in the labs, such as lamps and ceiling lights, but you can create other items, too. Once inside your building, you should spawn an object in front of your first-person controller. You should be able to pick up that object and take it up to the second floor so that you can throw it back down the stairs so that the item demonstrates all the proper physics.
